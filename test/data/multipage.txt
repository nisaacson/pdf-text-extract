Peak: Period of time when the need or demand for electricity on the Company's system is high, normally during the day, Monday through Friday, excluding holidays.

Demand Charge: The cost of providing electrical transmission and distribution equipment to accommodate your largest electrical load.

Delivery Service Charges are comprised of:

Distribution Charge: The cost of delivering electricity from the beginning of the Company's distribution system to your home or business. Transition Charge: Company payments to its wholesale supplier for terminating its wholesale arrangements. Transmission Charge: The cost of delivering electricity from the generation company to the beginning of the Company's distribution system. Energy Efficiency Charge: The cost of energy efficiency program services offered by the Company.

If you are not satisfied with the written decision or did not receive a written decision within 30 days, you have the right to appeal to the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities, Consumer Division, One South Station, Boston, MA 02110.

Department of Public Utilities
DPU regulations provide that a company may not terminate electric service for failure to pay any portion of a bill when a customer complaint or appeal is pending.

Right To Electric Service
If you have a financial hardship you (or anyone presently and normally living in your home) have a Right to Electric Service in the following situations:  During serious illness: Contact your physician or Board of Health and have them telephone the Company immediately at 1-888-211-1313. Within seven (7) days of the phone call your physician or Board of Health must certify in writing, to the Company, that serious illness exists. The certificate protects against termination for 90 days (180 days if chronic illness) and may be renewed. Your failure to renew such certification of serious illness as set out above may result in your service being terminated.  You have a child under twelve monthsold living in that home.  Between November 15 and March 15 if your service is heat related.  Elderly Household: If all residents in your household are 65 years of age or older; or a minor (under the age of 18), the Company can not terminate your service for failure to pay a past due bill without the approval of the Massachusetts Department of Public Utilities (DPU).  For additional information on the right to electric service, please contact our Credit Department at 1-888-211-1313.
